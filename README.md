## Technologies: 
- Flutter (dart) (for mobile app design)
- Django (python) (as RestAPI for schedule data)

## Description
App will be showing a weekly schedule for UR lecture.  
Data will be downloaded from django as RestApi request returning (json).

## Summary of project
Project is getting a data from api. Api has 2 endpoints:
1. gather all schedules
1. get details about a chedule by id

Both endpoints are used in settings in DropdownButton (select one) { One is used for a list of values to dropdownbutton, seconde one is used for gathering information from an api about a selected schedule}

Object is stored as String in SharedPreferences preffered way of storing data on client Side by flutter.

Each object have individual jsonMapper from Map.

User that choose a schedule, can got to the schedule section and view a schedule. 

If he wants to he can select a group, laboratories, specializations. If he does not select he will see all lectures.

## Schedule analysis
Schedule is assigned to year of study, field of study and current year, so each one from that is unique.
    
Schedule contains list of days ["monday","tuesday",...]  
Each day contains list of lectures.

Lecture contains information about itself.

Lecture is assigned to week:  
- 1/3 (first and third week of the month)  
- 2/4 (second and fourth week of the month)  
- all (each week of the month)  

Each lecture is assigned to:  
- full year (all students on year)
- main group (all students devided to groups most often 2)
- laboratories group (students from main groups devided to groups)

        Example:
            There are 100 students on year. They are divided to 2 groups, each group is divided to 2 laboratories group.

        - group 1: students from 1 - 50
            - laboratories 1: students from 1 - 25
            - laboratories 2: students from 26 - 50
        - group 2: studnets from 51 - 100
            - laboratories 3: students from 51 - 75
            - laboratories 4: students from 76 - 100

Each student is assigned to one main group, laboratories group and speciality (if division to speciality exists).
