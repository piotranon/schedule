## Author: Piotr DÅ‚ugosz

## Technologies:

// image preview of UI

## Schedule analysis
Schedule is assigned to year of study, field of study and current year, so each one from that is unique.
    
Schedule contains list of days ["monday","tuesday",...]  
Each day contains list of lectures.

Lecture contains information about itself.

Lecture is assigned to week:  
- 1/3 (first and third week of the month)  
- 2/4 (second and fourth week of the month)  
- all (each week of the month)  

Each lecture is assigned to:  
- full year (all students on year)
- main group (all students devided to groups most often 2)
- laboratories group (students from main groups devided to groups)

        Example:
            There are 100 students on year. They are divided to 2 groups, each group is divided to 2 laboratories group.

        - group 1: students from 1 - 50
            - laboratories 1: students from 1 - 25
            - laboratories 2: students from 26 - 50
        - group 2: studnets from 51 - 100
            - laboratories 3: students from 51 - 75
            - laboratories 4: students from 76 - 100

Each student is assigned to one main group, laboratories group and speciality (if division to speciality exists).
